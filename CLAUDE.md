## Core Development Principles

### 1. Task Management
- **Task Division**: Break all work into small, manageable tasks (max 2-4 hours each)
- **Task Numbering**: Use sequential numbering (task-001, task-002, etc.)
- **Subtask Definition**: Each task must have clearly defined subtasks
- **Documentation**: Store all task documentation in `/docs/tasks/` folder
- **Task Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool to track progress on all tasks
- **Requirements Reference**: Link tasks to specific requirements from `/Docs/Requirements/`

### 2. Development Workflow (Mandatory for Each Task)

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- **Requirements Analysis**: Review relevant sections in `/Docs/Requirements/` folder
- **Implementation Plan**: Create detailed implementation strategy
- **Impact Assessment**: Document which files/modules will be affected
- **Dependencies**: Identify all Laravel packages and Vue libraries needed
- **Database Review**: Check `/Docs/Requirements/database_schema.md` for table structures

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- **Modular Code**: Write clean, modular, reusable code
- **Code Standards**: Follow PSR-12 for PHP and Vue.js style guide
- **Type Hints**: Include type hints for all PHP methods
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks and proper validation
- **Logging**: Use Laravel's logging system for debugging
- **Follow Schema**: Implement exactly as defined in database_schema.md

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Write PHPUnit tests for all new features
- **Feature Tests**: Create tests for API endpoints
- **Frontend Tests**: Test Vue components with Vitest
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- **Bug Fixes**: Run all tests and fix issues before proceeding
- **User Story Validation**: Ensure implementation satisfies user stories

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Commit
- **Code Documentation**: Add PHPDoc comments to all methods
- **API Documentation**: Update API documentation for new endpoints
- **Git Commit**: Create detailed commit with task reference
- **Status Report**: Provide completion status and testing steps
